          <p>My first experience as a leader was in a summer camp where I was a leader in training (LIT as the program was called). Here I had to assist a senior counselor to monitor a cabin with 20 girls around 8 and 10 years old, and to help run different camp activities while also supervising a big number of children.</p>
          <p>It was here when I realized how much of an impact I could have in younger kids. In a position like this one they look up to you and you become their role model. I took this very seriously and loved influencing them in a positive way. Not only did this make me closer to the kids but the other LITs and counselors noticed and were impressed by my work.</p>

      <p>After this experience I pursued different summer jobs as a senior camp counselor and volunteer in different organizations with children. From every experience I grew and learned more about myself and my career goals.</p>
      <p>The culmination of my experiences was the summer of 2018. I went to South East Asia to volunteer and to backpack.</p>
      <p>Laos was my first destination and here I volunteered in a moon bears sanctuary and in a village called Sop Chem. The experience in this small village was transcendental for me, being able to immerse myself in the culture allowed me to learn from the people and to discover their realities. Then, for the rest of my backpacking experience I brought the communication skills that I developed in the village to learn from all the different people I encounter.</p>
      <p>The experience as a whole set a marking point in my professional development giving a clearer path I would like to follow once I graduate from the university.</p>
